# PRESCRIPTION SYSTEM FIX - TEMPORARY SOLUTION

## Issue Identified
The prescription system was failing because the TypeScript schema was updated to include the `expiresAt` field, but the database migration wasn't applied yet. This created a mismatch where the frontend was sending data with the expiration field, but the database didn't have the column.

## Temporary Fix Applied
1. **Commented out `expiresAt` field** from the prescriptions table schema
2. **Disabled expiration functionality** in both editor and patient views
3. **Removed validation** for the expiration field
4. **Added TODO comments** throughout the code for easy restoration

## Database Migration Required
Execute this command in your Neon SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if column exists first:
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'prescriptions' AND column_name = 'expires_at';

-- If no results, add the column:
ALTER TABLE prescriptions ADD COLUMN expires_at timestamp;
```

## Files Modified (Temporarily)
- `shared/schema.ts` - Commented out expiresAt field
- `client/src/pages/nutritionist/prescription-editor.tsx` - Disabled date picker
- `client/src/pages/patient/prescription-view.tsx` - Disabled expiration warnings

## To Restore Expiration System
After successfully running the database migration:
1. Uncomment the `expiresAt` field in `shared/schema.ts`
2. Restore the date picker in prescription editor
3. Restore expiration warnings in patient view
4. Remove all TODO comments

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Execute database migration in Neon SQL Editor  
2. ✅ Test prescription creation/editing works
3. ⬜ Restore expiration functionality after migration
4. ⬜ Test complete expiration system
