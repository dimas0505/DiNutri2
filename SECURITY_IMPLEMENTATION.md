# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This implementation addresses critical security vulnerabilities in the authentication system by implementing proper authorization controls.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`shared/schema.ts`)
- Added `authorizedNutritionists` table to control who can have nutritionist role
- Added `patientInvitations` table to manage patient invitations via secure tokens
- Added proper relations and TypeScript types for the new tables

### 2. Authentication Security (`server/auth.ts`)
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Removed automatic nutritionist role assignment for all users
- Added authorization check against `authorizedNutritionists` table
- Only pre-approved emails can become nutritionists
- Unauthorized users are properly denied access
- Added `requireNutritionist` middleware for role-based access control

### 3. Storage Layer (`server/storage.ts`)
- Added methods for checking authorized nutritionists
- Added methods for managing patient invitations
- Proper database operations for the new security tables

### 4. API Routes (`server/routes.ts`)
- Updated all patient and prescription routes to require nutritionist role
- Added invitation management routes:
  - `POST /api/invitations` - Create patient invitation
  - `GET /api/invitations/validate/:token` - Validate invitation token
  - `POST /api/invitations/accept/:token` - Accept invitation
- Proper authorization middleware on all sensitive endpoints

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
npm run db:push
```

### 2. Seed Authorized Nutritionists
1. Edit `scripts/seed-nutritionists.ts` and add authorized email addresses
2. Run the seed script:
```bash
npm run db:seed
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure all required environment variables are set:
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `AUTH0_DOMAIN`
- `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` 
- `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `BASE_URL`
- `SESSION_SECRET`

## Security Features

### For Nutritionists
- Only pre-authorized emails can access the platform
- Full access to patient management and prescription features
- Can generate invitation links for new patients

### For Patients (Future Implementation)
- Can only access via:
  1. Manual registration by nutritionist
  2. Valid invitation token from nutritionist
- Limited to viewing their own prescriptions

### Token Security
- Invitation tokens are cryptographically secure (32-character nanoid)
- Tokens expire after 7 days
- Tokens can only be used once
- Proper validation on all token operations

## Testing
Run the included security tests:
```bash
npx tsx test/auth-security.test.ts
```

## Migration Notes
- Existing users with nutritionist role should be added to `authorized_nutritionists` table
- The system will deny access to any user not in the authorized list
- Patient invitation system provides secure onboarding for new patients
