# Database Migration Required

## Issue Fixed
The application was showing a 500 error when fetching patients because the database schema was updated but the migration wasn't applied to the production database.

## Solution Applied
- **Temporarily reverted** the schema changes to restore application functionality
- **Generated migration file**: `migrations/0003_crazy_wrecker.sql` which adds the new columns when ready
- **Preserved the migration** so it can be applied when database access is available

## Migration File Created
```sql
ALTER TABLE "patients" ADD COLUMN "status" varchar DEFAULT 'active' NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE "prescriptions" ADD COLUMN "expires_at" timestamp;
```

## Next Steps
**To fully implement the prescription lifecycle features:**

1. **Apply the database migration** in production:
   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit push
   ```

2. **Re-enable the schema changes** by uncommitting the temporary fixes in this commit

3. **Test the new features:**
   - Patient status control (active/inactive)
   - Prescription expiration dates
   - Automatic filtering of expired prescriptions

## Files Changed in This Fix
- `shared/schema.ts` - Removed new columns temporarily
- `server/storage.ts` - Removed references to new columns
- `server/routes.ts` - Removed new functionality that depends on new columns
- Frontend files - Removed UI components for new features

The application should now work normally with existing patients and prescriptions visible again.
